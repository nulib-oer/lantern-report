## Summary of Grant Expenses

In our original proposal we budgeted \$2,007 for an in-person training event. With the switch to remote work, we altered our budget to commit \$2,500 to pay honoraria of \$500 each to librarians from across the country to do an in-depth review of the toolkit.

The review was followed by a recorded Zoom interview in which received feedback, comments, and suggestions. In the end, we recruited six librarians for the review, increasing this line item to \$3000.

Fortunately, we hired a Northwestern Libraries colleague to complete the accessibility audit for \$1000, which was much less expensive than hiring a specialized company.

In the end, \$441.26 was left unspent due to unforeseen student employee scheduling issues.
